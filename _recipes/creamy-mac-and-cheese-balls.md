4. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, salt, and black pepper until the cheese is melted.
5. Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and mix well. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
6. Roll the mac and cheese mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls.
7. Dip each ball into the beaten eggs, then roll in the seasoned breadcrumbs.
8. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pot to 350Â°F.
9. Fry the mac and cheese balls in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
10. Drain the fried mac and cheese balls on a paper towel-lined plate and serve hot. Enjoy!
