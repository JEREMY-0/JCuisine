**Here is a recipe for a fluffy omelette:**

# Ingredients:

* 3 eggs
* 1 tablespoon milk or water
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* Optional fillings (such as cheese, ham, vegetables, herbs)

# **Directions:**

1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them with a fork until the yolks and whites are fully combined. Whisk in the milk or water, salt, and pepper.
2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and swirl it around until it's melted and the bottom of the skillet is coated.
3. Once the butter has melted, pour in the egg mixture. Use a spatula to gently stir the eggs, moving them from the edges of the pan to the centre.
4. When the eggs begin to set, stop stirring and let them cook for a minute or two until the bottom is golden brown and the top is no longer runny.
5. If using fillings, add them to one side of the omelette. Use the spatula to fold the other side of the omelette over the fillings.
6. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately. You can garnish with some chopped herbs or shredded cheese on top.

Enjoy your fluffy omelette!
