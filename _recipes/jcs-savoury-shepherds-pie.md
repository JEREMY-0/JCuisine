### Here is a recipe for a savoury shepherd's pie:

## Ingredients:

**For the meat filling:**

* 1 pound ground beef or lamb
* 1 onion, diced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 cup beef or chicken broth
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/2 cup frozen peas
* 1/2 cup frozen carrots

**For the mashed potato topping:**

* 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and chopped
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or lamb over medium-high heat. Drain off any excess fat.
3. Add the onion and garlic to the skillet and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.
4. Stir in the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the beef or chicken broth and cornstarch. Pour the mixture into the skillet and stir until well combined.
6. Add the frozen peas and carrots to the skillet and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.
8. Add the milk and butter to the pot with the potatoes and mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
9. Spread the meat filling evenly into a 9x13 inch baking dish.
10. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat filling, spreading them out evenly.
11. Sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed potatoes.
12. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the shepherd's pie is heated through.
13. Let the shepherd's pie cool for a few minutes before serving.
